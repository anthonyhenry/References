        <h1>Adding Images</h1>
        <!-- The empty tag <img> is used to add images to a website -->
        <!-- The <img> tag requires an src and alt attribute -->
        <!-- The src attribute tells the browser where to find the image to embed -->
        <!-- It is common to save images in the same folder as your html file and use a relative link to get the image -->
            <!-- As your website grows, it is a good idea to put images into a seperate folder and even subfolders -->
        <!-- The alt attribute provides a text description of the image if the browser cannot display the image for some reason -->
        <!-- You can also use the title attribute to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers display the content of this attribute as a tooltip when a user hovers over the image -->
        <img src="Images/05_Images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian marsupial that is similar in size to the domestic cat.">

        <h1>Figure and Figure Caption</h1>
        <!-- The <figure></figure> and <figcaption></figcaption> elements were introduced to keep images and captions connected to one another -->
        <!-- The <figure></figure> element can hold more than one image, as long as they share the same caption -->
        <!-- Browsers sometimes indent the contents of the <figure></figure> element -->
        <figure>
            <!-- The <img> tag(s) goes within the <figure></figure> element -->

        <!-- Some tips for using images in websites -->
            <!-- Use jpeg, png, or gif image formats -->
            <!-- Use jpeg for images that have many different colors in them -->
            <!-- Use gif or png for images with few colors in them -->
            <!-- Gifs can be used for animated images -->
            <!-- gif and png files can use transparent backgrounds -->
            <!-- Try to save the image at the same size it will appear in the website, for best quality and to avoid slow load times -->
            <!-- Always measure images in pixels, not inches or centimeters -->
            <!-- It is common to set an image's pixels per inch to 72ppi for web use -->

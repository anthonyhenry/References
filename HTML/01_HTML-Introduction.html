<!-- HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. -->
<!-- The HyperText part refers to the fact that HTML allows you to create links that move from one page to another -->
<!-- A markup language allows you to annotate text -->

<!-- In HTML we annotate text with tags -->
<!-- An opening tag, a closing tag, and the content in between are referred to as an element, but the terms tag and element are often used interchangably -->
<!-- Tags give meaning to how text appears and functions on a web page -->


<!-- All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html> -->
<!-- The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly. -->
<!-- The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive. -->
<!-- The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is: <!DOCTYPE html> -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>. -->
<html lang="en-US"> <!-- You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers. -->
<!-- Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element -->
<!-- Attributes appear only on opening tags and are made up of two parts: a name (always in lowercase) followed by an eaual sign and a value enclosed in quotation marks -->

    <!-- The <head> element contains information about the page. -->
    <!-- This inforation is not shown visually in the webpage -->
    <head>
        <!-- Inside the <head> element you will find the title of the web page -->
        <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>

    <!-- Everything inside the <body> element is shown visually in the webpage -->
    <body>
        Hello World!
    </body>
</html>
